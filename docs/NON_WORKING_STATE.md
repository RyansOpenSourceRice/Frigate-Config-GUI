# Non-Working State Disclosure

This repository may contain code paths, features, or workflows that are incomplete, experimental, or currently non-functional. These parts are included to aid development and collaboration, but they are not guaranteed to work at this time.

What this means:
- Some features are stubbed or behind feature flags
- Some build targets or packaging flows may be temporarily broken
- Documentation may describe planned features that are still in progress
- Issues and PRs labeled with `non-working` or `prefunctional` indicate known gaps

How to help:
- Open an issue clearly describing the non-working behavior and expected outcome
- If you submit a PR, link to the issue and describe any limitations
- Avoid depending on non-working parts in production environments

Status transparency:
- We strive to mark non-working areas in docs or code comments where feasible
- CI will be configured to surface known breakages where appropriate
