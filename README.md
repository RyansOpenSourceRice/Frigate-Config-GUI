## Overview

Frigate Config GUI simplifies the configuration of Frigate NVR systems by providing a modern, intuitive interface for managing YAML configurations. Built with enterprise-grade technologies and designed for users of all technical levels.

### Planned Features

- **Visual Configuration**: Intuitive interface for all Frigate settings
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on configuration changes
- **Multi-language Support**: Will support all UN official languages

Note: Many features are still under development. Please check the project status before using in any environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- For Linux: flatpak and flatpak-builder
- For Windows: WiX Toolset (for building MSI)

### Installation

⚠️ **Note: This application is in early alpha and not yet available on Flathub**

The application will be distributed through Flathub for Linux systems. For now, you must build from source:

1. Follow the [Building from Source](#building-from-source) instructions below
2. Use at your own risk - this is alpha software
3. Report issues on GitHub
4. Backup your Frigate configuration before using this tool

For detailed instructions, see our [Installation Guide](docs/user/installation.md).

### Building from Source

#### Quick Build (Recommended)

We provide a comprehensive build script that handles all prerequisites and builds both the app and Flatpak package:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/frigate-config-gui.git
   cd frigate-config-gui
   ```

2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./tools/build-all.sh
   ```

The script supports several options:
- `--app-only`: Build only the Electron app
- `--flatpak-only`: Build only the Flatpak package
- `--dev`: Start development environment

#### Manual Build

If you prefer to build manually:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. For Flatpak, use the dedicated script:
   ```bash
   ./tools/build.sh
   ```

For detailed build instructions, see our [Build Guide](docs/dev/building.md).
